## Requirements

This website requires >= php 7.0. I've personally been running it on a Vagrant Homestead Ubuntu box via Virtualbox.
Had some issues getting php_mcrypt onto the box as it's deprecated, but seemed to fix after running "sudo apt-get install php-mcrypt"
The database is currently set to go to the default homestead mysql database when first setting up the Homestead machine, so
you may want to change that.

## Security

The routing incorporates filtering for CSRF checks throughout the site, in order to protect against cross site hacking.
Encrypted the unique image url with the built in Hash class so that if the database gets hacked you'd need to know the encryption key in the app config to stand much of a chance of unencrypting the information
The unique image url is a generated by the random_bytes method so it's pseudo-random rather than having something based on the user ID or a unix timestamp
Stored unique images have been put into the storage folder so that they lie behind the public path and thus can't be directly accessed via a URL.
One can only obtain the unique image by visiting a URL that checks to see if you are the authorised user the image has been assigned to, making the image pretty impossible to get to all in all.

## Other Stuff

You may want to run a migration/seed so that you get some content on the homepage.
The paypal settings are all configured in the app config file
